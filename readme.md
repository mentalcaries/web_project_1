Learning How to Learn - A Practicum Project

This webpage combines the first and second sprints of the Practicum syllabus and focuses on HTML and CSS. Classes are named according to BEM methodologies with just about all of the styling being done via CSS. There was a great deal of practice and variety in positioning elements with and without flexbox.

The second sprint was based on the first project, but involved changing the file structures to be BEM compliant. While this was certainly tedious, it definitely helped from an organisational standpoint.

Other modifications from sprint 2 included the addition of YouTube videos using iframe, transitions for links on hovering, and most notable at first glance, the use of animations on the website.

This site is not yet responsive, but that may be modifications that can be added after later lessons.
Some refactoring can be done once some clarification is obtained regarding the use of margins vs padding in some sections.

As mentioned at the end of the exercise, once the green light is given from the code review, the following will be considered:
    Adding different fonts
    Adding additional videos - definitely worth including something from Richard Feynman
    Checking the code for cross-compatibility and adding all the necessary vendor prefixes
    Designing a form that allows users to submit a comment- possibly some email contact.
